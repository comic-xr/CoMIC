--- Persona 3: Bernard (Withdrawn, History of Depression) ---

Name: Bernard

General Well-Being & Mood:
Q: How would you describe your overall mood over the past few weeks?
A: Pretty low, mostly. Flat. Not much interest in things.
Q: What emotions do you find yourself experiencing most often (e.g., happiness, sadness, anxiety)?
A: Sadness, I suppose. Apathy. Just feeling... grey.

Social Connections and Support:
Q: How often do you interact with family, friends, or members of your community?
A: Not much. The carer comes in daily for half an hour. My nephew calls maybe once a month. That's about it.
Q: Do you often feel lonely or isolated? If yes, when does this feeling typically arise?
A: Yes, most of the time. Especially afternoons and evenings. All the time, really.

Daily Routines and Interests:
Q: Can you describe a typical day for you?
A: Get up when the carer comes. Watch TV mostly. Read the paper sometimes. Stare out the window. Not much else.
Q: What activities or hobbies bring you joy or help you relax?
A: Nothing really brings joy anymore. Used to like woodwork, but can't manage it now. Sometimes watching old films is okay, passes the time.

Mental Health History and Coping Strategies:
Q: Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition, or have you sought help from a mental health professional?
A: Yes, depression, years ago. Took medication for a while. Haven't seen anyone recently.
Q: What methods or activities have you found helpful in managing stress, anxiety, or sadness?
A: Don't really manage it. Just try to get through the day. Sometimes putting the radio on helps fill the silence.

Emotional Expression and Communication:
Q: How comfortable are you discussing your emotions or personal challenges?
A: Not very. Don't see the point. Who wants to hear it?
Q: What type of language or tone makes you feel understood and supported?
A: I don't know. Quiet, maybe. Not too cheerful. Just... calm.

Expectations from a Digital Companion:
Q: What qualities do you value most in a supportive companion or conversational partner?
A: Someone that listens. Doesn't interrupt. Doesn't judge.
Q: In what ways would you like a chatbot to assist you during difficult times?
A: Maybe just listen? Let me talk without offering advice I don't want. Just be there.

Technology Use and Accessibility:
Q: How comfortable are you using digital devices for communication?
A: Not comfortable at all. Have an old mobile for emergencies, barely use it. Don't have a computer or tablet.
Q: Do you have any preferences or difficulties with technology that we should consider?
A: It's all too complicated. Needs to be extremely simple. Voice would be the only way I could use something like this.

Privacy and Trust:
Q: How important is confidentiality when discussing your personal feelings?
A: Suppose it's important, but if I'm not talking much anyway...
Q: Do you have any concerns about sharing personal information with a digital tool?
A: Not really thought about it. If it helps, maybe it's okay.
