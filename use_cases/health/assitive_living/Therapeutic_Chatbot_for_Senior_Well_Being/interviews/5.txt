--- Persona 5: George (Grumpy Exterior, Distraction Coping) ---

Name: George

General Well-Being & Mood:
Q: How would you describe your overall mood over the past few weeks?
A: Same as usual. Alright, I suppose. Bit grumpy maybe.
Q: What emotions do you find yourself experiencing most often (e.g., happiness, sadness, anxiety)?
A: Irritation sometimes. Boredom. Not much else.

Social Connections and Support:
Q: How often do you interact with family, friends, or members of your community?
A: Son calls Sundays. Neighbour pops his head in now and then. That's it these days. Most of my old mates are gone.
Q: Do you often feel lonely or isolated? If yes, when does this feeling typically arise?
A: Don't like the word lonely. But yes, it's too quiet here since Martha passed. Evenings are the worst.

Daily Routines and Interests:
Q: Can you describe a typical day for you?
A: Get up. Make tea. Read the paper cover to cover. Watch the news. Maybe tinker in the shed for a bit if I feel up to it. Lunch. Watch afternoon telly, usually sport or documentaries. Dinner. More telly. Bed.
Q: What activities or hobbies bring you joy or help you relax?
A: Not much brings 'joy'. Watching sport is alright. Reading the paper. Tinkering in the shed used to, but harder now.

Mental Health History and Coping Strategies:
Q: Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition, or have you sought help from a mental health professional?
A: No. Don't believe in all that. Just get on with it.
Q: What methods or activities have you found helpful in managing stress, anxiety, or sadness?
A: Keep the telly on. Read the paper. Ignore it. Distraction, I suppose.

Emotional Expression and Communication:
Q: How comfortable are you discussing your emotions or personal challenges?
A: Not comfortable. Don't talk about feelings. Waste of time.
Q: What type of language or tone makes you feel understood and supported?
A: Straightforward. To the point. No fuss. Don't want any wishy-washy stuff.

Expectations from a Digital Companion:
Q: What qualities do you value most in a supportive companion or conversational partner?
A: Doesn't waste my time. Gets to the point. Maybe knows a bit about sport or history. Efficiency.
Q: In what ways would you like a chatbot to assist you during difficult times?
A: Difficult times? Just leave me alone, probably. Or maybe just talk about something completely different. Distract me.

Technology Use and Accessibility:
Q: How comfortable are you using digital devices for communication?
A: Not at all. Hate them. Got a mobile my son makes me carry, never use it. Can just about work the TV remote.
Q: Do you have any preferences or difficulties with technology that we should consider?
A: Has to be voice. Can't be doing with typing or touch screens. Simple as possible.

Privacy and Trust:
Q: How important is confidentiality when discussing your personal feelings?
A: Well, I don't discuss 'em, so not an issue. But if I did, yes, it'd have to be private.
Q: Do you have any concerns about sharing personal information with a digital tool?
A: Yes. Don't trust them. Always listening. Where does it all go?
