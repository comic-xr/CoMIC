# WebRTC Performance Testing Framework

A comprehensive framework for testing WebRTC performance with local video files, focusing on GCC (Google Congestion Control) performance.

## Features

- **Local Video Streaming**: Use test videos instead of webcam feeds for consistent testing
- **Role Definition**: Explicitly define sender and receiver roles
- **Real-time Metrics**: Monitor bandwidth, RTT, packet loss, and frame rate
- **Puppeteer Automation**: Script to automate testing with different configurations
- **Network Condition Simulation**: Test with artificial delay, packet loss, and bandwidth constraints

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
