# CoMIC: A Collaborative Mobile Immersive Computing Infrastructure for Conducting Multi-user XR Research
CoMIC aims to offer a collaborative, visual-first, and hologram-based computing space and a QoE-driven, multi-site, and immersive communication framework for advancing research on multi-user XR.

Supported by an NSF CCRI award, this project brings together investigators from George Mason University [(link)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2235049) and the University of Maryland [(link)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2235050) to build the CoMIC infrastructure.
